Calculator

This is a basic calculator application that uses eventlistener to allow keyboard typing to punch inputs into the calculator. 
The original Odin project does not require adding square root, but I did it anyways.
The calculator only allows 2 digit decimal calculations; otherwise, they are rounded. Preventing overflow not implemented.
All other project specifications fully functional.

This is my take on the fourth project assignment found on the Odin Project's Foundation course.

This application is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
